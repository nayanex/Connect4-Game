**Connect Four** (also known as **Captain's Mistress**, **Four Up**, **Plot Four**, **Find Four**, **Fourplay**, **Four in a Row**, **Four in a Line** and **Gravitrips** (in Soviet Union) ) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a strongly solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

The game was first sold under the famous *Connect Four* trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.
